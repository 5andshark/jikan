# Jikan

Jikan is an unofficial MyAnimeList PHP/REST API that covers the critical features which the official API lacks.

The old docs are available [here](https://jikan.me/old-docs)

# Rate Limiting
To maintain bandwidth, there's a rate-limiting of 5,000 requests per IP per day and 2 concurrent requests per second.

Per Day: **2,000**

Concurrent: **2**/second

# Allowed HTTP(s) requests
<pre>
GET: All requests are done via GET
</pre>

# Response Headers
- 200 `OK` - the request was successful.
- 400 `Bad Request` - You've made an invalid request or to an invalid endpoint.
- 404 `Not Found` - The ID you requested doesn't exist
- 405 `Method Not Allowed` - requested method is not supported for resource.
- 429 `Too Many Requests` - You've either hit your daily limit, concurrent limit or Jikan has hit the rate limit from MyAnimeList


# Errors
If you get an error response, it'll be within the `error` field. Here's an example:
```
{"error": "Something happened";}
```

Here's a list of errors you can get and what you could do to over come them.

### Invalid extended request / Unsupported parse request
Check each method for their proper extended requests. For example `/episodes` may exist for anime, but it doesn't exist for manga.
### MyAnimeList Rate Limiting reached
Jikan has made too many requests to Jikan and there's a rate limit in effect from them. This only lasts for a few seconds.
If you're making API calls in bulk, I suggest adding a delay between each request.

You won't face this issue if there's enough cache laying around.
### ID/Path not given
This message comes from JikanPHP, the core of the REST API. Which pretty much translates to "You haven't provided any anime/manga/character/person `ID` to request.

If you get any other error, it's most likely a PHP error from JikanPHP itself. Please file an [issue](https://github.com/jikan-me/jikan/issues) on the GitHub repo.

## Anime [/anime/{id}/{request}/{parameter}]
