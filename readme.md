## The REST API & Documentation is available at [https://jikan.me](http://jikan.me)

Jikan is an OOP based class written in PHP that scrapes and parses data out of MyAnimeList. It provides you an easy syntax that can fetch Anime, Manga, People, Character details and even user lists. It returns the data in an array and has a built-in method that converts it to JSON.

The raison d'être for Jikan is to provide an easy API for being able to get stuff that the official API of MyAnimeList lacks.

Jikan even has it's own REST API that responds in JSON - [Get Started](http://jikan.me)
